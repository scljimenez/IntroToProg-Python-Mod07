# Pickling and Error-Handling Script:

## 1.1 Introduction:

##### This paper describes my script which addresses pickling and error-handling. Using the Separation of Concerns principles, I divided my script into one section for pickling and one for error-handling. These sections includes subsections for declaring data, processing data, and presenting or interacting with the user to obtain new data.

## 2.1 Pickling Article


## 2.2 Declaring Variables & Pickling Data:

##### For this section, I defined two variables: a binary file that would be used to store existing and new data, and a list variable that stored the data I wanted to pickle. Knowing that pickling can store and load complex sets of data, I created a list containing three elements. These variables can be seen in Figure 1. In Figure 1, my list is a variable which stores different book titles, which are represented as strings:
